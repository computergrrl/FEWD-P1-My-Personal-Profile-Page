        <h2>Background </h2> 
        <p>I’m problem-solving computer "nerd" who loves to code. Originally from Arizona, I'm now living happily in the Pacific Northwest where I work at Treehouse. I enjoy learning coding as much as I enjoy helping students on their own learning journeys! </p>
        <p>One thing I love about working a Techdegree on Treehouse is the challenge of working through a project from beginning to end. There's something so satisfying about taking some skeleton project files and building them out into an amazing finished product that I can be proud of and show off! </p>
        <p>
          I have some experience already with PHP, HTML and Javascript, but there are a lot of elements regarding CSS, and JS that still confuse and frustrate me. Hopefully I will overcome that as I make my way through this Front End Web Development Techdegree!

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to continue to sharpen the skills I have and add to them and hope to one day have a well-rounded skillset in the topics such as:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Fullstack JavaScript</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d ultimately like to work behind the scenes as a software engineer or developer for an inclusive company with a socially responsible mission.  </p>
